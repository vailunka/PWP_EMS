__Remember to include all required documentation and HOWTOs, including how to create and populate the database, how to run and test the API, the url to the entrypoint, instructions on how to setup and run the client, instructions on how to setup and run the axiliary service and instructions on how to deploy the api in a production environment__

30.1.2025: In the database implementation we decided to go with SQLite used via SQLAlchemy. If SQLite proves to be too lightweight for our purposes, we will change the SQLite to MySQL in SQLAlchemy.
